title: About Me

I'm a software engineer residing in West Palm Beach, Florida.
I grew up in Pittsburgh tinkering with computers and have always had a passion for puzzles and problem solving.
I got started with Linux and programming with Python in the early 2000's, teaching myself before formally studying software engineering and haven't looked back since.
I'm always up for a challenge, so feel free to reach out if you have an interesting project.

When I'm not at my computer I'm probably on my bicycle.
